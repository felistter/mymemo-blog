      "body": "In 1995, hundreds of thousands of people across the world protested against the obscenity of French nuclear tests in the Pacific; millions of people in Germany boycotted Shell petrol in anger at Shell’s attempt to sink the Brent Spar oil platform and its waist into the Atlantic Ocean. In 1996, thousands of people joined protests against the building of the Newbury by-pass and other road schemes; millions were outraged by the disastrous oil swill in South-west Wales when the Sea Empress ran aground; and revelations about the potential damage to humans caused by ‘mad cow disease’ led virtually the whole population of Europe to question the way in which our food is produced.\n\nEvery day, it seems, we read or hear about the environmental problems facing the planet. Scientific reports, predicting disaster if human society continues the way it is going, get more and more regular. But it’s not just scientists now: people across the entire planet are no longer leaving it to “the experts”.\n\nThis broad movement is to be welcomed. It represents the desire of people for a better world, to move beyond the narrow, insecure, boring, and limiting life we’re often forced to live under this system.\n\nWe stand in the tradition of the pioneers of the socialist movement, who placed the health and safety of working people and the fight for a cleaner, pleasanter and healthier world at the forefront of their struggle.\n\nEarly trade unions fought against pollution, bad housing, contaminated food and water. Many of the major improvements in the environment – for example, in hygiene, with better housing, clean public water supply, sewage disposal and food standards – were, at least in part, due to workers’ struggles. Workers’ organizations, such as the Co-operative movement in its early days, and even local Labour parties, such as Bermondsey in south London, established their own bakeries to provide unadulterated, affordable bread.\n\nThe right for most people to enjoy the countryside had to be fought for. The mass trespasses, demanding open access to moorland in the 1930s, were often organized by unions and the Communist Party, and resulted in the establishment of the National Parks after the war, by the 1945 Labour government. Modern socialists carry on the struggle of those workers, living in bad housing in polluted cities, who wanted access to fresh air and beauties of the countryside and fought the rich landowners in their country mansions for it. Today, the battle continues against the Criminal Justice Act, the back-door privatization of Forestry Commission land and landowners’ constant attempt to charge for, or even stop, enjoyment of the countryside.\n\nThe leaders of the Labour Party, now New Labour, have completely abandoned struggle and action, preferring deals with the bosses. These leaders have refused to support any direct action. Although the leaders of the traditional Labour and socialist parties internationally have given up struggle, this hasn’t stopped people fighting back, in unions, community groups and environmental organizations. Across the world new socialist organizations are emerging that stand for struggle. Environmental battles are now often led, instead, by Green Parties, organizations like Greenpeace and Friends of the Earth, and a wide variety of single-issue campaigns. But are they enough? Is there a connection between the wide variety of different campaigns that environmentalists are involved in? And is there a solution to the environmental crisis?",
